# Math-Modeling-Project-1
To run the model run Project_1_Main(X) where X is your matrix of students and their grades in each class.
You can instead run Project_1_Main() and a fake data set (1700 students, 400 classes, A+,A,A- grading scale) will be generated for you.
Output: low decile, high decile, ranked list

To test the model's sensitivity run testofSensitivity_Testing(). Sensitivity testing will be run on the model and will test all four grading types.
Output: standard deviation, mean, ANOVA
